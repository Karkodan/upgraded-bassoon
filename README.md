Overview
upgraded-bassoon is a modular Python application tailored for efficient data processing and analytics. It leverages best practices in coding, testing, and documentation to ensure reliability and maintainability across diverse use cases.

Goals

Deliver robust, high-performance functionality for data-driven tasks.
Emphasize clean architecture, easy scalability, and streamlined collaboration.
Create an intuitive interface for end-users of all skill levels.
Confidence Level: 9/10 (Flexible enough for various Python workflows, but you’ll need to customize details.)

Key Features
Modular Architecture: Each feature is encapsulated into independent modules, allowing for hassle-free updates and improvements.
Extensive Logging: Built-in logging hooks help track performance and debug issues quickly.
Configurable Workflows: Adjust settings using environment variables or config files, making it ideal for different deployment environments.
Confidence Level: 9/10 (Great design principles, but specifics may vary based on your actual code.)
